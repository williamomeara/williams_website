Hello! I'm William, a software engineer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable solutions. My career has spanned continents—from Ireland to Australia and Cambodia—where I've developed software for betting platforms, mining operations, and network management systems.

## My Journey
After graduating from University College Dublin with a strong foundation in computer science, I embarked on international experiences that broadened my horizons. Working abroad taught me adaptability, cross-cultural collaboration, and the importance of diverse perspectives in tech.

## Beyond Work
When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
- Traveling and immersing myself in new cultures
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Staying current with technology trends
- Exploring outdoor activities

## Philosophy
I believe in continuous learning and embracing challenges. Whether it's deploying microservices on Kubernetes or teaching English to children in Cambodia, I approach every endeavor with enthusiasm and dedication.

I'm excited to bring my global experience and technical expertise to new opportunities closer to home.
