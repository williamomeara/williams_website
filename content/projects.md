# Projects

## Maximum Clique Enumeration using Machine Learning
Explored a supervised learning framework to address the NP-hard problem of maximum clique enumeration, which arises in network analysis tasks across domains like data mining, decision-making, and routing. Developed an edge-based approach with advanced feature engineering to predict edges not part of any maximum clique, enabling graph pruning for more efficient exact optimization algorithms. Implemented using Python and machine learning techniques, demonstrating superior results compared to existing node-based methods and handling larger problem instances.

## Herd Manager Website using Django
Developed a full-stack web application using Django for the backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. The app scrapes government agricultural data APIs, allows farmers to input herd details, and visualizes herd value trends over time with interactive charts. Features include user authentication, data export, and responsive design. Deployed on AWS with Docker for scalability.

## Ecommerce Website using Django
Built a comprehensive e-commerce platform for a startup clothing company using Django REST Framework for APIs, React for the frontend, and Stripe for payments. Implemented features like product catalog, shopping cart, user reviews, and order management. Integrated with AWS S3 for image storage and used Redis for caching to improve performance. Ensured security with HTTPS and data validation.

## Letterbooked - Book Discovery Platform
